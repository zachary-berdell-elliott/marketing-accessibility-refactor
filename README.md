## Original Site

The site was for a pretend marketing company. The site lists the services and perks of the marketing company. It had no semantic elements, too many unneccessary classes, and a broken link.

## Updated HTML

The HTML has been updated with semantic elements to make the document easier to read for other programmers and to make the website more accessible for people with disabilities. Added elements include nav, section, article, header, footer, and aside. Classes and ids have been renamed and simplified. A broken link at the top has also been fixed.

## Alt attributes

Alt attributes have been added to the images to assist people who have images disabled and people with screen readers.

## Updated CSS

The css document has been updated to work with the semantic elements. unneccessary classes have also been removed and combined into one class. Comments added to better describe what the code is doing.
